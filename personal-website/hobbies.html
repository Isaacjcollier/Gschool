          <h2>Disc Golfing</h2>
          <h5>Frisbee golfing</h5>

          <p>Disc Golfing is a sport that I have been actively doing for the past 5 years. It is something that I was introduced into by my oldest brother, Joshua Collier.</p>

          <h5>About Disc Golfing</h5>

          <p>Disc golf is played much like traditional golf. Instead of a ball and clubs, however, players use a flying disc, or Frisbee®. The sport was formalized in the 1970's, and shares with "ball golf" the object of completing each hole in the fewest strokes (or, in the case of disc golf, fewest throws). A golf disc is thrown from a tee area to a target which is the "hole". The hole can be one of a number of disc golf targets; the most common is called a Pole Hole® an elevated metal basket. As a player progresses down the fairway, he or she must make each consecutive throw from the spot where the previous throw has landed. The trees, shrubs, and terrain changes located in and around the fairways provide challenging obstacles for the golfer. Finally, the "putt" lands in the basket and the hole is completed. Disc golf shares the same joys and frustrations of traditional golf, whether it's sinking a long putt or hitting a tree halfway down the fairway. There are few differences, though. Disc golf rarely requires a greens fee, you probably won't need to rent a cart, and you never get stuck with a bad "tee time." It is designed to be enjoyed by people of all ages, male and female, regardless of economic status. <br><br> For more information,<br> visit  <a href='http://www.pdga.com/introduction'>PDGA's official website</a></p>

          <h2>Board Games</h2>
          <h5>European/Eurostyle Board Games</h5>

          <p>I have been both collecting and playing board games for about 4 years, It is one of my favorite hobbies of all time. It combines 2 of my most desirable elements, social interaction, and competitive playing.</p>

          <h5>About Euro Board Games</h5>

          <p>"Eurostyle games focus on creating tight mechanics that function like a well-oiled machine. These mechanics are usually within a small, self-contained system, and are generally simpler and easier to learn. (There are a few pretty complex Euro games out there, but again, these are just generalities.)" <br><br>For more information,<br> visit this <a href="http://islaythedragon.com/guides/guide-to-gaming-ameritrash-vs-eurostyle-whats-the-difference/"> board game website</a></p>

          <p>I have a huge passion for video games, both new and old, primarily the old! I have been collecting retro video games for 4 years now. They just don't make them like they used to!</p>
          <h5>About Retro Video Games</h5>

          <p>Pretty much anything from the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) to the Current Generation Console, I play and collect it all. It's an activity I particularly enjoy with friends and family, it is one of many ways I enjoy interacting with a group of people. it allows everyone to connect in a competitive and/or sometimes cooperative way.</p>
